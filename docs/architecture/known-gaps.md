# Known Architectural Gaps

This doc tracks current architectural violations in the codebase — places where the rules in [`archetypes/`](archetypes/) (and module `CLAUDE.md` files) don't yet match reality. Each entry describes the gap, why it exists, and what closing it would require.

Gaps are tracked here (and not enumerated inside the archetype docs themselves) so the rule docs stay durable and conceptual, while the concrete list of divergences lives in one searchable place.

## No known gaps yet

Two Cents is greenfield: the code is being written against these archetypes from the start, so there are no recorded divergences. This file is the home for architectural violations *as they arise* — when a module ends up out of compliance with its archetype (a peer reaching into another module's `adapters/`, a non-`repo.go` file importing `sqlc`, an external client growing persistence), record it here rather than weakening the archetype doc. Each entry should name the rule violated, where, why it exists, and what closing it would require.
